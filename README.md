# SMD2FBX

Nothing special. Converts simple SMD files to FBX. No Skeletons at this time.

While working on a project for Unreal some of the source assets from the game we were porting from the Source Engine were lost, but we had the SMD files, so this tool was created.

Requires the FBX SDK for python.
